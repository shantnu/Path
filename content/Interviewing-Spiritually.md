# Interviewing Spiritually

 

## How NOT to panic at interviews

 

I discovered the [Course in Miracles](/course-in-miracles) at a bad point in my life, which actually turned out to be a good thing. As I wrote in the article [The Gift of Suffering] (/Gift-Of-Suffering) , suffering is good for you, spiritually, as it forces you to question your life.

 

For me, I lost my job, and the company found a legal way to ding my redundancy pay, so that I would only get a fraction of what I thought I was getting. Maybe it was my mistake for expecting too much, but the fact was, I was out of a job, little or no savings, a little baby and wife to take care of.

 

And there were zero jobs in my area. Zero. I’d have to move hundreds of miles away, *provided* I could get a job.

 

I was interviewing furiously, but still had a lot of free time, so I went back to meditation, something I had given up for years.

 

It was at this stage that I started talking to the Inner Teacher. It was from him that I found this inspiring line from the Course:

 

*I am a Teacher of Light. I do not have to worry about what to say or do, because he who sent me will guide me. I will be healed, even as I teach others to heal.*

 

Specially this part: *I do not have to worry about what to say or do, because he who sent me will guide me.*

 

This became my mantra before every interview. Earlier, I was always tense, stressful and angry. I took the usual idiotic advice given by recruiters: Act interested in the company, ask them questions etc. But this only made me sound desperate (at least to myself).

 

But then I started following the mantra of the Course: He Who Sent me will tell me what to say.

 

And I stopped worrying, knowing the Universe would tell me what to say.

 

And you know what? It worked. I just knew what to say, and when, and every company I interviewed with was impressed, and 2 gave me offers.

 

But the best part was going into an interview smiling, not tense, because I knew it wasn’t just me, but the whole Universe supporting me in that Interview.
