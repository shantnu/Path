# A Meditation to Deal with Stressful Job Interviews

 

## Or How NOT to panic at interviews

 

I discovered the [Course in Miracles](/course-in-miracles) at a bad point in my life, which actually turned out to be a good thing. As I wrote in the article [The Gift of Suffering] (/Gift-Of-Suffering) , suffering is good for you, spiritually, as it forces you to question your life.

 

In 2017, I lost my job, and the company found a legal way to ding my redundancy pay, so that I would only get a fraction of what I thought I was getting. Maybe it was my mistake for expecting too much, but the fact was, I was out of a job, little or no savings, a little baby and wife to take care of.

 

And there were zero jobs in my area. Zero. I’d have to move hundreds of miles away, *provided* I could get a job.

 

I was interviewing furiously, but still had a lot of free time, so I went back to meditation, something I had given up for years.

 

It was at this stage that I saw this inspiring line from the Course:

 

*I am a Teacher of Light. I do not have to worry about what to say or do, because he who sent me will guide me. I will be healed, even as I teach others to heal.*

 

Specially this part: *I do not have to worry about what to say or do, because he who sent me will guide me.*



 If you don't believe in God, replace *he* with the Inner Teacher, Higher Self, Buddha Nature or the Universal Intelligence.



This became my mantra before every interview. Earlier, I was always tense, stressful and angry. I took the usual idiotic advice given by recruiters: Act interested in the company, ask them leading questions etc. But this only made me sound desperate (at least to myself). *Please sirrr, gimme job sirrr, I'll do anything, clean your car, wash your clothes, sirrr*.

So I gave up on traditional advice and started following this technique:

## Interview Mantra

On the day of the interview, I would say the Mantra to myself a few times.

Then, when I reached the company, I would turn off the car, btu keep sitting in it. If possible, finding a park or natural area is also a good idea.

Then repeat the saying again at least 3 times:

*I do not have to worry about what to say or do, because he who sent me will guide me.*

Then I would go to the interview smiling. I refused to think at all about all the disaster scenarios if I didn't get the job. Instead, if I got any worrying thought, I would replace it with *My Higher Self will guide me if that occurs.*

And I actually felt a Higher Intelligence was guiding my path. I knew just what to say and when, I was relaxed and confident, and for the first time in my 15 year career, I actually laughed in the interview, instead of acting like I had diarrhea and the interviewer was an interrogator trying to get a confession out of me, which is how I normally interviewed ☺ 

The interview process became easy, I got more job offers, including one I accepted, including a significant pay rise. The funny thing is, the company is one I would normally have ignored because of some personal biases, but because I was listening to the Higher Self, I decided to apply anyway.

**Finally** 

I still use this Mantra whenever I face any stressful situation. I remind myself that I do not have to worry about everything, try to control everything, for the Inner Teacher will guide me on what to do. And it works wonders everytime ☺
