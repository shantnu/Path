                            <h1 id="a-meditation-to-deal-with-stressful-job-interviews">A Meditation to Deal with Stressful Job Interviews</h1>

<h2 id="or-how-not-to-panic-at-interviews">Or How NOT to panic at interviews</h2>

<p>I discovered the <a href="/course-in-miracles">Course in Miracles</a> at a bad point in my life, which actually turned out to be a good thing. As I wrote in the article <a href="/gift-of-suffering">The Gift of Suffering</a> , suffering is good for you, spiritually, as it forces you to question your life.</p>

<p>In 2017, I lost my job, and the company found a legal way to ding my redundancy pay, so that I would only get a fraction of what I thought I was getting. Maybe it was my mistake for expecting too much, but the fact was, I was out of a job, little or no savings, a little baby and wife to take care of.</p>

<p>And there were zero jobs in my area. Zero. I’d have to move hundreds of miles away, <em>provided</em> I could get a job.</p>

<p>I was interviewing furiously, but still had a lot of free time, so I went back to meditation, something I had given up for years.</p>

<p>It was at this stage that I saw this inspiring line from the Course:</p>

<p><em>I am a Teacher of Light. I do not have to worry about what to say or do, because he who sent me will guide me. I will be healed, even as I teach others to heal.</em></p>

<p>Specially this part: <em>I do not have to worry about what to say or do, because he who sent me will guide me.</em></p>

<p>If you don’t believe in God, replace <em>he</em> with the Inner Teacher, Higher Self, Buddha Nature or the Universal Intelligence.</p>

<p>This became my mantra before every interview. Earlier, I was always tense, stressful and angry. I took the usual idiotic advice given by recruiters: Act interested in the company, ask them leading questions etc. But this only made me sound desperate (at least to myself). <em>Please sirrr, gimme job sirrr, I’ll do anything, clean your car, wash your clothes, sirrr</em>.</p>

<p>So I gave up on traditional advice and started following this technique:</p>

<h2 id="interview-mantra">Interview Mantra</h2>

<p>On the day of the interview, I would say the Mantra to myself a few times.</p>

<p><em>In this interview, I do not have to worry about what to say or do, because he who sent me will guide me.</em></p>

<p>Then, when I reached the company, I would turn off the car, but keep sitting in it. If possible, finding a park or natural area is also a good idea.</p>

<p>Then repeat the saying again at least 3 times:</p>

<p><em>I do not have to worry about what to say or do, because he who sent me will guide me.</em></p>

<p>Then I would go to the interview smiling. I refused to think at all about all the disaster scenarios if I didn’t get the job. Instead, if I got any worrying thought, I would replace it with <em>My Higher Self will guide me if that occurs.</em></p>

<p>And I actually felt a Higher Intelligence was guiding my path. I knew just what to say and when, I was relaxed and confident, and for the first time in my 15 year career, I actually laughed in the interview, instead of acting like I had diarrhea and the interviewer was an interrogator trying to get a confession out of me, which is how I normally interviewed ☺</p>

<p>The interview process became easy, I got more job offers, including one I accepted, including a significant pay rise. The funny thing is, the company is one I would normally have ignored because of some personal biases, but because I was listening to the Higher Self, I decided to apply anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Finally</strong></p>

<p>I still use this Mantra whenever I face any stressful situation. I remind myself that I do not have to worry about everything, try to control everything, for the Inner Teacher will guide me on what to do. And it works wonders everytime ☺</p>
